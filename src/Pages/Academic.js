          <p>
            The school is not doing badly academically in view of the myriads of
            challenges the children face in persuit of their academic work. Many
            parents hardly fend for the educational needs of their wards, thus
            taking most active times out of their study periods as they persue
            menial jobs to support their education and livelihood.
          </p>
          <p>
            In an attempt to arrest the situation, teachers have voluntered
            their time to do a free extra classes to help mould those who are
            not able to master reading at the JHS level. It is believed that
            much input would be directed to this fit to make our collective
            dreams possible.
